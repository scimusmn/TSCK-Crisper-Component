This code is only a "proof of concept" for the Crisper Component.  This code demonstrates the feasilibilty of reading MIFARE classic 1K RFID tags using a MRFC522 card reader, and storing new RFID tag UIDs in EEPROM to be referenced later in the main loop.  Eventually, an Adafruit TCS34725 color sensor will be integrated into the project.  The intent is to have a certain output pins from the Arduino go "HIGH" and "LOW" respectively when certain RFID tag UIDs and color values are matched in the conditional statements.  The Adafruit TCS34725 library is already included in the code, to test for any conflicts with the MRFC522 library.  The MRFC522 card reader uses SPI, and the Adafruit TCS34725 color sensor uses I2C.
